- What was the most challenging part?

  -Annoying little bugs that I was working on for quite a while but turned out to be trivial.

  -At first I thought the backend was going to be a challenge but eventually it became fun and intuitive.

- Which aspects of the application did you enjoy implementing?

  -I liked the backend implementation, I haven't had a chance to work with it that much so far but I managed it and it was fun and challenging.

- Any suggestions for improvement?

  -The first time I saw the project I thought it was simple and that I would finish it quickly but as I continued to work and get further and further the more complicated it seemed but at the same time it made me even more ambitious.

  I think this project is very good. If you want to check that someone has the right skills for the job, this project will take them through many basic and probably daily working tasks.
